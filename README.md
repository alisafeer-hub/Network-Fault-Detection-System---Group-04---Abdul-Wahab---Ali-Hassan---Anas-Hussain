**Vehicle Sensor Fault Detection: Execution Guide:**





This document outlines the requirements and steps necessary to execute the model training and generate the required deployment assets for the Vehicle Sensor Fault Detection system.





**Requirements:**



Ensure the following Python libraries are installed to run the training script successfully:



1. pandas
2. numpy
3. scikit-learn
4. pickle (Standard library, but essential for saving/loading)





**Execution Steps: Training and Asset Generation:**



The core training and saving process is handled by executing the main Python script block. This process trains the machine learning model and calculates the physics constants necessary for real-time fault attribution.



Execution in Jupyter/Interactive Environment



To run the training process, simply copy and paste the entire contents of the Model Training code file into a single cell of your Jupyter Notebook (or Python interactive session) and execute the cell.

You will find the **manual execution code ** inside the **Source Code folder**.
